# ADR 002: Testing model in DOM/integration tests

**This ADR superseeds ADR-001.**

*Describe here the forces that influence the design decision, including technological, cost-related, and project local.*

We want to avoid testing implementation details in our integration tests.

We want to use `react-testing-library` which makes it easier to make assertions on the rendered DOM rather than assert implementation details. But mostly because it enable us to find and trigger click events on different UI elements.
e.g. toggling the visibility of different tabs and window groups.

When it comes to asserting the rendered DOM, in most cases we trust the view will render the model properly.  It could be more sensible to only verify the state/model.

## Decision 
*Describe here our response to these forces, that is, the design decision that was made. State the decision in full sentences, with active voice ("We will...").*

We will assert both against the session in the provider **and** against the DOM elements to make sure the application view is updating properly.

## Rationale 
We had a small problem described in ADR-001.

## Status
[Accepted]

## Consequences
We'll see...
